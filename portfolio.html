            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>We had to redesign a website from scratch. We chose to work with Fabro, an italian restaurant based in Copenhagen. </p>
            <h2>Role in the project</h2>
            <p>I coded a page on the website, created SVG files for logos and recorded and edited parts of an interview with the owner of Fabro.</p>

            <h1>About </h1>
            <p>Our asignment was to deliver a piece of media inspired by PrivatSnak, that would teach younger students about what is legal and illegal to share on the internet.</p>
            <h2>Role in the project</h2>
            <p>I created several SVGs, made an ad that could be used on social media and edited some of the soundeffects in the game.</p>

            <h1>About </h1>
            <p>The asignment was to create a piece of media that would encourage students to appear in class more often. Our idea was a 'Battle App' that would reward students who spent more time in class.</p>
            <h2>Role in the project</h2>
            <p>I sketched the app, drew and created most of the SVGs and helped create the XD Prototype that we had to showcase. </p>
